      <p>There are a few basic things every orchid owner should consider
      if they entertain any hope of keeping their orchid alive after ther
      first bloom is finished:</p>
      <h5>When should I water my orchid?</h5>
      <p>Orchids don't need much water.  For home orchids, you only need to water once every 7-10 days.  Careful not to overwater.  Depending on the type of orchid, you will follow a different watering schedule.</p>
      <h5>When should I fertilize my orchid?</h5>
      <p>Make certain you are using an orchid-friendly fertilizer first.  Follow the instructions of the particular fertilizer, however, orchids should be fertilized on average once per month.  Over-fertilization as well as under-fertilization will inhibit the orchid blooming cycles.
      <h5>Help!  My orchid has stopped blooming.  What do I do now to encourage it to bloom once again?</h5>
      <p>Commercial varieties of orchids are easy to stimulate to rebloom.  When the bloom is finished, cut your flower stem just below the lowest bloom, but above a node.  After cutting the stem, seal it with cinnamon or melted wax to prevent an infection.  If you pamper your orchid with quality care, a rebloom will likely occur
      <h5>There are so many varieties of orchids.  How do I give mine the special care that it needs?</h5>
      <p>Care can vary from orchid to orchid. See the following table below:</p>
